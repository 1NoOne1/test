# Dell PowerEdge 620/730 Servers â€“ Update iDrac Firm Ware/Settings/Device Drivers using RACADM.

This will update Firmware/Device Drivers, change/modify iDrac/Bios Settings using Racadm command line tool on Dell PowerEdge 620 and 730xd models. We will connect to the local racadm which resides in iDrac and execute the required commands using the Ansible RAW module. We use HTTP repository share from which we will update the recommended updates and these updates were created in the form a catalog using Dell Repository Manager.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

* You should a system/VM running linux with --  `CentOS Linux release 7.0.1406 (Core) or above available`.
* Install Python --version:  `python version = 2.7.5.`
* [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) should be installed --version:  `ansible 2.3.1.0`.
* Pip (Python package Index) should installed using `epel-release`. --version: `pip 8.1.2 from /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)`.
* Jinja2 should be installed using `pip install jija2`. --version: `Jinja2 (2.7.2)`.
* A `HTTP server` should be setup, running and should be accessible to iDrac hosts. This is the location where we host Dell FW updates as HTTP share from which iDrac hosts would be able to download the required Firmware/device drivers.
 
### Installing
Download/Clone the Repository and place the directory structure as shown above. We are following the directory structure that is mentioned in anisble best practices. Please follow the below links for more understanding on how ansible directory structure works:
1. http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout
2. https://leucos.github.io/ansible-files-layout


### Inventory Setup

`inventory/hosts` : We will configure the entire stack by listing our hosts in the 'hosts' inventory file, usually grouped by their purpose:
* This file holds all the variables for individual hosts, for host-groups. **Make sure you change the values of the variables accordingly in this file**
```yaml
[all:children]
idrac_hosts
#r620_servers
#r730_servers

#[r620_servers]
#10.231.9.46 idrac_racname=r6c03-bmc model=620

#[r730_servers]
#10.231.9.40 idrac_racname=r6c12-bmc model=730

[idrac_hosts]
#r620_servers
#r730_servers
10.231.9.46 idrac_racname=r6c03-bmc model=620

mgmt_netmask=255.255.255.0


```

```yaml
[all:children] => main parent group
idrac_hosts     --- 
#r620_servers      | --> host groups
#r730_servers   ---

#[r620_servers]                                               
#10.231.9.46 idrac_racname=r6c03-bmc model=620  | --> host in-line variables that can be used in playbooks (applicable to only this host).

[idrac_hosts]
10.231.9.46 idrac_racname=r6c03-bmc model=620

#[r620_servers:vars]     | --> variables that are defined for the host-group (applicable to all the hosts in this group).

ansible_ssh_pass=******
ansible_ssh_user=root
idrac_dns1=10.231.0.101
...
...
...
```
### Run the Playbook
*Once we are done with defining all the required variables we are now ready to execute our playbook on the hosts by running the following command from the terminal*

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/deploy_server_roles.yml
```
* **deploy_server_roles.yml** `=>` which holds the following five roles that gets executed accordingly. If you don't want a role to be executed then simply comment out that line in the YAML file.

```yaml
  roles:
#    - role: ../roles/Firmware_Updates
    - role: ../roles/Raid_R620
      when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 620)'
#    - role: ../roles/Raid_R730
#      when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 730)'
    - role: ../roles/iDrac_Settings
    - role: ../roles/iDrac_BIOS_Settings

```
* The roles are :
 ```yaml
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Role                            | Description                                                                                |
+=================================+============================================================================================+
| 1. ../roles/Firmware_Updates    | Compare against the HTTP catalog and run any updates if available.                         |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. ../roles/Raid_R620           | Reset the RAID forcefully and re-create RAID-1 across first two disks.                     | 
|                                 | Runs only when `raid_force` is set to true in `inventory/hosts`                            |
|                                 | [when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 620)'].                     |          
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. ../roles/Raid_R730           | Reset the RAID forcefully and re-create RAID-1 across first two disks.                     |
|                                 | convert any SSDs into Non-RAID. Runs only when `raid_force` is set to true in              |
|                                 | `inventory/hosts`. [when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 730)'].  | 
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. ../roles/iDrac_Settings      | Modify/Update the iDrac settings using the variable values mentioned in invenroty/hosts.   |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. ../roles/iDrac_BIOS_Settings | Modify/Update the BIOS settings using the variable values mentioned in invenroty/hosts.    |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
## Example Scenarios:

#### Per Rack basis - Rack having 620s and 730s:

Let's say we have a rack containing both R620 and R730 models and we would like to deploy them in one go then we can do as:

* Modify the `inventory/hosts` file that includes the R620 and R730 Hosts.
```yaml
[all:children]
idrac_hosts

[idrac_hosts]
r6c01-bmc 10.231.9.21 idrac_racname=r6c01-bmc model=620 # model parameter is necessary, If it is blank/not equals to 620 then RAID role won't be running on that host (coupled with raid_force variable host group vars below).
r6c02-bmc 10.231.9.22 idrac_racname=r6c02-bmc model=620
r6c03-bmc 10.231.9.23 idrac_racname=r6c03-bmc model=730 # model parameter is necessary, If it is blank/not equals to 730 then RAID role won't be running on that host (couple with raid_force variable in host group vars below).
r6c04-bmc 10.231.9.23 idrac_racname=r6c03-bmc model=730

[idrac_hosts:vars]
ansible_ssh_pass=******
ansible_ssh_user=root
idrac_dns1=10.231.0.101
idrac_dns2=10.231.0.103
idrac_gateway=10.231.9.1
idrac_netmask=255.255.255.0
idrac_domainname=encore-oam.com
raid_force=false # set to TRUE if you want to run RAID role on the host (coupled with model variable above).
catalog_http_share=10.231.7.155/DellRepo/072017 # HTTP server where we host the Dell Firmware catalog Repository.
mgmt_vlanid=104
mgmt_gateway=10.7.20.1
mgmt_netmask=255.255.255.0
```
* Modify the `playbooks/deploy_server_roles.yml` file so that it runs [asynchronously](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_strategies.html), this way the we can eliminate host dependency on each other. 
```yaml
- name: Deploy Server Full Automation
  hosts: idrac_hosts  # should match the host group that we set in the inventory/hosts files
  strategy: free      # runs in asynchronous fashion
  user: root
  become: yes
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    target_array:
      - { target: 'BIOS.SysProfileSettings.SysProfile', job_target: 'Bios.Setup.1-1', target_set: 'SysProfile', value: 'PerfOptimized' }
      - { target: 'bios.biosbootsettings.BootMode', job_target: 'Bios.Setup.1-1', target_set: 'BootMode', value: 'Bios' }
      - { target: 'nic.nicconfig.1.LegacyBootProto', job_target: 'NIC.Integrated.1-1-1', target_set: 'LegacyBootProto', value: 'NONE' }
      - { target: 'nic.nicconfig.3.LegacyBootProto', job_target: 'NIC.Integrated.1-3-1', target_set: 'LegacyBootProto', value: 'PXE' }
  roles:
    - role: ../roles/Firmware_Updates
    - role: ../roles/Raid_R620
      when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 620)'
    - role: ../roles/Raid_R730
      when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 730)'
    - role: ../roles/iDrac_Settings
    - role: ../roles/iDrac_BIOS_Settings

```

#### Per Rack basis - either R620s or R730s.

If we want to run only on the R620 (or) only on R730 models, then we can do the following: 

* Modify the `inventory/hosts` file that includes the R620 / R730 Hosts.
```yaml
[all:children]
R620_hosts

[R620_hosts]
r6c01-bmc 10.231.9.21 idrac_racname=r6c01-bmc model=620 # model parameter is necessary, If it is blank/not equals to 620 then RAID role won't be running on that host (coupled with raid_force variable host group vars below).
r6c02-bmc 10.231.9.22 idrac_racname=r6c02-bmc model=620

[R620_hosts:vars]
ansible_ssh_pass=******
ansible_ssh_user=root
idrac_dns1=10.231.0.101
idrac_dns2=10.231.0.103
idrac_gateway=10.231.9.1
idrac_netmask=255.255.255.0
idrac_domainname=encore-oam.com
raid_force=false # set to TRUE if you want to run RAID role on the host (coupled with model variable above).
catalog_http_share=10.231.7.155/DellRepo/072017 # HTTP server where we host the Dell Firmware catalog Repository.
mgmt_vlanid=104
mgmt_gateway=10.7.20.1
mgmt_netmask=255.255.255.0
```
* Modify the `playbooks/deploy_server_roles.yml` file so that it runs in a linear and synchronous way. During this playbook LINEAR run, ansible waits for each task to be completed on all the hosts before it move on to execute the next task.

```yaml
- name: Deploy Server Full Automation
  hosts: R620_hosts  # should match the host group that we set in the inventory/hosts files
  #strategy: free      # runs in asynchronous fashion
  user: root
  become: yes
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    target_array:
      - { target: 'BIOS.SysProfileSettings.SysProfile', job_target: 'Bios.Setup.1-1', target_set: 'SysProfile', value: 'PerfOptimized' }
      - { target: 'bios.biosbootsettings.BootMode', job_target: 'Bios.Setup.1-1', target_set: 'BootMode', value: 'Bios' }
      - { target: 'nic.nicconfig.1.LegacyBootProto', job_target: 'NIC.Integrated.1-1-1', target_set: 'LegacyBootProto', value: 'NONE' }
      - { target: 'nic.nicconfig.3.LegacyBootProto', job_target: 'NIC.Integrated.1-3-1', target_set: 'LegacyBootProto', value: 'PXE' }
  roles:
    - role: ../roles/Firmware_Updates
    - role: ../roles/Raid_R620
      when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 620)'
    - role: ../roles/Raid_R730
      when: '(raid_force | bool) and (model is defined and model == 730)'
    - role: ../roles/iDrac_Settings
    - role: ../roles/iDrac_BIOS_Settings

```

#### Per Role Basis - Run only specific roles
